Deep learning model accuracy = 88%

Logistic Regression model accuracy = 88%, hyperparameter tuning does not improve this.

the majority of loss is due to difficulty differentiating between "confirmed" and "candidate" exoplanets. An additional metric (whatever is used to confirm a candidate as an exoplanet) would help improve the model. 

I believe that 88% accuracy is good enough to predict new exoplanets. And most likely that number will be higher once the "candidates" are confirmed as real exoplanets.
